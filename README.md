This program calculates the area of a circle and the area of an equilateral triangle

### 1. Calculation of the surface of a circle
### 2. Calculation of the face of an equilateral triangle

#### 1. When calculating the surface area of a circle, we need its radius, and pi is exactly 3.14


![We enter the radius as text and declare the value of Pi](/images/inputRadius.png)

#### We enter the radius as string and declare the value of Pi

#### 2. Now we need to convert the radius we entered

### 2. Calculation of the face of an equilateral triangle
#### 1. Let us be given the sides a, b of an equilateral triangle

The formula for calculating the area of an equilateral triangle is S=1/2*a*h, h is the height of the triangle, we can find it using the Pythagorean formula c^2=a^2+b^2

after finding its height, we can calculate its face
