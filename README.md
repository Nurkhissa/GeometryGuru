#### 1. When calculating the surface area of a circle, we need its radius, and pi is exactly 3.14


![We enter the radius as text and declare the value of Pi](/images/inputRadius.png)

#### We enter the radius as string and declare the value of Pi

#### 2. Now we need to convert the radius we entered
